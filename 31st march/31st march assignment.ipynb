    "4) Resources: In most cases, companies providing web hosting services offer additional services. This can be automatic backups, website builders, etc. Cloud hosting providers usually offer only the server itself."

    "\n",
    "1) Eliminate friction: A mobile-first approach to responsive web design will help designers evaluate what’s really necessary in order for the user to achieve their main objective.\n",
    "2) Design for thumbs: Mobile users typically hold their devices in their hands, so it’s important to design for thumbs.\n",
    "3) Take advantage of mobile devices’ native hardware: Mobile devices have a lot of native hardware that can be used to enhance the user experience. For example, you can use the accelerometer to detect when the device is being tilted.\n",
    "4) Make layouts fluid/adaptive by default: Fluid layouts are more flexible and can adapt to different screen size.\n",
    "5) Don’t forget about landscape orientation: Landscape orientation is often overlooked in responsive design, but it’s important to consider.\n",
    "6) Remember, typography can be responsive too: Responsive typography is an important part of responsive design. You should choose fonts that are legible on all screen sizes"
