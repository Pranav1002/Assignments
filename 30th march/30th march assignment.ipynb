    "- Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the penalties from both the Lasso and Ridge techniques. It is a mix of both Ridge and Lasso Regressions, and the penalty term is a combination of both absolute value and squared value penalties.\n",
    "- The main difference between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques is that it uses both L1 and L2 regularization techniques.\n",
    "- The L1 regularization technique is used to create sparse models by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero. The L2 regularization technique is used to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients towards zero."
