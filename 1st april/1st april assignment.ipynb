L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model’s coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model’s coefficients\n",
    "- Regularization helps prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and making it more generalizable to new data. By adding a penalty term to the cost function, regularization encourages the model to use only the most important features and avoid overemphasizing noise in the data."

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. A perfect classifier would have an AUC of 1.0, while a random classifier would have an AUC of 0.5.\n",
    "- The ROC curve is useful because it allows us to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity (the true positive rate) and specificity (the true negative rate) at different threshold settings. By adjusting the threshold setting, we can increase sensitivity at the cost of specificity or vice versa."
