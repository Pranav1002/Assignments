    "- A decision tree is a tree-structured classifier that is used for both classification and regression problems. It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions. In order to build a tree, we use the CART algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm.\n",
    "- A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer (Yes/No), it further splits the tree into subtrees. The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset. \n",
    "- The root node represents the entire dataset, which further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. Leaf nodes are the final output node, and the tree cannot be segregated further after getting a leaf node.\n",
    "- The logic behind the decision tree can be easily understood because it shows a tree-like structure"

    "1) Entropy and Information Gain: Decision trees use the concept of entropy to measure the impurity or disorder of a set of examples. Entropy is a mathematical measure of uncertainty. If a dataset contains only one class, the entropy is 0 (perfectly pure). If the dataset contains an equal number of examples from each class, the entropy is at its maximum (maximum impurity).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Splitting Criteria: The decision tree algorithm aims to find the best feature or attribute to split the data at each internal node. To determine the best split, different splitting criteria are used, with the most common one being information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Information Gain: Information gain measures the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the data based on a particular attribute. The attribute with the highest information gain is chosen as the splitting attribute at each node. It indicates how much information about the class is gained by knowing the value of that attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Splitting the Data: Once the attribute with the highest information gain is selected, the data is split into subsets based on the possible values of that attribute. Each subset represents a branch of the decision tree, and the process is recursively applied to each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Stopping Criteria: The recursive splitting process continues until a stopping criterion is met. Common stopping criteria include reaching a maximum depth of the tree, having a minimum number of examples at a node, or achieving a pure class (entropy of 0) at a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Classification at Leaf Nodes: Once the tree is constructed, classification is performed by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on the attribute values of a given example. The class label associated with the leaf node reached is then assigned as the predicted class for that example."
