    "- Precision and recall are two performance metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Precision measures the proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.\n",
    "- In the context of a confusion matrix, precision is calculated as TP / (TP + FP), while recall is calculated as TP / (TP + FN). A high precision means that the model is making few false positive predictions, while a high recall means that the model is correctly identifying most of the positive instances.\n",
    "- In general, precision and recall are inversely related. Increasing one will often lead to a decrease in the other. The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single score by taking their harmonic mean."
